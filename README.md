Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that 
repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order (i.e., if the first item is greater than the second item). 
This process is repeated until the list is sorted.


When to Use Bubble Sort:
Educational Purposes: Bubble sort is often used in educational contexts to introduce the concept of sorting algorithms due to its simplicity and clarity.

Small Data Sets: In scenarios where the dataset is small or nearly sorted, and simplicity is prioritized over efficiency, Bubble Sort can be considered.

Learning and Analysis: Analyzing Bubble Sort can provide insights into how sorting algorithms work and their trade-offs, which can be valuable for learning purposes.

In summary, while Bubble Sort is straightforward and useful in certain contexts, its inefficiency limits its practical use in most real-world applications where faster and more efficient sorting algorithms are preferred.
